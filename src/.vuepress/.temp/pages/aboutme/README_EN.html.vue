<p>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</p>
<p>I will be joining the WeiBo Ai Lab at Sina Group as a research engineer. I received my Master's Degree in June 2021 from the Artificial Intelligence Academy, the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>I have been a student at the State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences supervised by Prof. Xiaolong Zheng, focus on Natural language processing.</p>
<p>My research interests are in recommender systems, computational advertising, and information retrieval, and broader interests include comparative learning, Multi-modal Pre-training model, transfer learning, and their applications in advertising, search, and recommendation.</p>
<p>Coding is probably my favorite thing. I am looking for Ph.D. opportunities as well as research assistant/intern positions. Please drop me an <a href="mailto:pu.miao@foxmail.com">email</a> Research Interests</p>
